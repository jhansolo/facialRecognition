implements the eigenface algorithm discussed by Turk and Pentland.
run "main.py" in your python IDE to see the results.

2 ways to view the results:
    #1(default)- graphic pop-up window showing the 10 known subjects, the chosen test face, and the eigenface reconstruction
         of the test face. If the test face belongs to one of the 10 known subjects, an arrow will identify that 
         subject. If the test face does not belong to the 10 know subjects, a "new face" message will appear. If the 
         test face is not a face at all, a "not a face" message will appear
    #2 - cycles through the entire database and checks for the accuracy of the algorithm's predicitions against all of them.
         Displays the subject number chosen, the guess made, and overall accuracy statistics
         
uses numpy, pandas, and cv2
